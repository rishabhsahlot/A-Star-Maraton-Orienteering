# A\* Variable Terrain,Season,Elevation- Marathon Orienteering

This project is an implementation of A\* based shortest all node-traveral algorithm (like TSP) in a real-world like environment(varying elevation,water, seasons & their influences).
The person is trying to Orienteer a hike marathon, and may have to walk, run, climb or swim to complete the marathon.

## How To Run

TO run the algorithm type in:
'python lab1.py {Path of image} {Path of Elevation Map} {Visiting Points} {Season} {Save Image Path}'

Path of Image :- The path of map image, which identifies the type of terrain at each pixel/location.
Path of Elevation :- The path of evelation map image, which identifies the altitutde above sea level at each pixel/location.
Visiting Points :- The path of file containing all locations/pixels in the image map to stop at, in their order.
Season :- Winter(7 pixels of lake ring freeze, so they are walkable), Spring(15 pixels of muddy water around lake), Summer, Fall,
Save Image Path :- The file path at which the image map with path embedded is to be stored.
